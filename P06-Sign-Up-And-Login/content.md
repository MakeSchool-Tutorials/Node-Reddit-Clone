Alright next step! Its time to allow people to take responsibility for the silly things they are posting on our Reddit clone. We are going to create user accounts so folks can securely signup and login using a username and password.

1. Create a post
1. Show all posts
1. Show one post
1. Comment on posts
1. Create subreddits
1. **Sign up and Login**
  1. Make `/sign-up` route, template and form
  1. Make POST `/sign-up` route and logic
  1. Make `User` model
  1. Encrypt users' passwords
  1. Create JWT and add Cookies
  1. Demonstrate that user is logged in and password is encrypted
  1. Make `/login` route, template and form
  1. Make POST `/login` route and logic
1. Associate posts and comments with their author
1. Make comments on comments
1. Vote a post up
1. Sort posts by # of votes

# Make `/sign-up` Route

Always think first about what the user's experience should be, and then develop for that. We'll follow the convention of a "sign up / login" links living in the navbar of our project.

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
  <div class="container">
    ...
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
      <li><a href="/login">Login</a></li>
      <li><a href="/sign-up">Sign Up</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

Now that we have the links, let's make the `/sign-up` route work. We can make a new controller file called `auth.js` to put all our authentication routes.

```js
module.exports = (app) => {
  // SIGN UP FORM
  app.get('/sign-up', (req, res) => {
    res.render('sign-up');
  });
}
```

Now we can create our sign up form with `username` and `password` fields.

# Make the POST Route to `/sign-up`

Use the template code you used to create a post but alter it to fit a username/password form. Don't forget:

1. Set the password input field type to `password`
1. Set the action of the form to `/sign-up`
1. Put the form in the middle third of the grid.

Define a User model. Add a new file called `user.js` in your `models` folder.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  createdAt       : { type: Date },
  updatedAt       : { type: Date },
  password        : { type: String, select: false },
  username        : { type: String, required: true }
});

// Define the callback with a regular function to avoid problems with this
UserSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  // SET createdAt AND updatedAt
  const now = new Date();
  this.updatedAt = now;
  if ( !this.createdAt ) {
    this.createdAt = now;
  }
  next();
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Next define a route `/sign-up`.

```js
const User = require('../models/user');

module.exports = (app) => {
  ...
  // SIGN UP POST
  app.post('/sign-up', (req, res) => {
    // Create User
    const user = new User(req.body);

    user.save().then((user) => {
      res.redirect('/');
    }).catch((err) => {
      console.log(err.message);
    });
  });
}
```

Now we have a user model, but if we save our password it will be saved in our database as plaintext and not be secure.

# Encrypting the Password

The special issue we have with users is we can't know the users' password, we have to encrypt it. To do that we'll use a project called `bcrypt` that gives us some easy methods to encrypt passwords and save a secure "password digest" instead of the actual password.

All this bcrypt logic will live in the user model. What we'll do is:

1. Install `bcrypt` to our project and require it in our model
1. Add a method to our user model that detects if the `password` attribute is being modified, and if it is salt and has the password to produce a password digest that we'll save into the database.
1. Lastly, make a model method called `comparePassword()` that takes in an attempted password and returns true or false if the attempt matches what is in the database.

You'll need to 'salt' the password. Read about 'salting' [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)). While you can include a your secret 'salt' value in an environment variable that is accessible throughout node. We can use `dotenv` library to help. 

1. Install `dotenv`. 
1. Then you'll need to create a file in the root of your project named `.env` and define a variable with `SECRET=somehashvalue`, where 'somehashvalue' can be any random set of characters. 
1. Last, `require('dotenv').config();` as early as possible in your project. Adding it at the top of `server.js` is probably a good idea. 

Read more about `dotenv` [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

Read this implementation closely and add implement the same into your `User` model.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
    createdAt       : { type: Date },
    updatedAt       : { type: Date },
    password        : { type: String, select: false },
    username        : { type: String, required: true }
});

// Must use function here! ES6 => functions do not bind this!
UserSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  // SET createdAt AND updatedAt
  const now = new Date();
  this.updatedAt = now;
  if ( !this.createdAt ) {
    this.createdAt = now;
  }

  // ENCRYPT PASSWORD
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) {
    return next();
  }
  bcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt) => {
    bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, (err, hash) => {
      user.password = hash;
      next();
    });
  });
});


UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function(password, done) {
  bcrypt.compare(password, this.password, (err, isMatch) => {
    done(err, isMatch);
  });
};

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Now let's sign up and check if our password was encrypted. We'll be able to see if the password is salted and hashed, and later we'll be able to test if the encryption actually worked when we create the login form.

# Create JWT Tokens and Cookies

Besides just creating a user document when the user signs up, we also want to log that user in to our application. What does it mean to be logged in? To be authenticated?

In our case, being logged in will mean that there is an authentic JWT token - a JSON Web Token - set as a cookie. This token is another piece of neat encryption that uniquely identifies a specific user.We'll use a one library called `jsonwebtoken` to generate this token, and then we'll use `cookie-parser` to set this token as a cookie.

```bash
$ npm install cookie-parser jsonwebtoken -s
```

# Use Middleware to handle tokens

Use middleware to to authenticate tokens and attach them to `req` object passed to routes. 

First we generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) so we need to require the npm module `jsonwebtoken` we just installed into our `auth-controller.js` and then use it to generate a JWT after the new user document is saved.

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
...
// SIGN UP POST
  app.post('/sign-up', (req, res) => {
    // Create User and JWT
    const user = new User(req.body);

    user.save().then((user) => {
      var token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, process.env.SECRET, { expiresIn: "60 days" });
      res.redirect('/');
    }).catch((err) => {
      console.log(err.message);
      return res.status(400).send({ err: err });
    });
  });
 ...
```

Next we need to set the JWT as a cookie so that it will be included in all future requests from the current user's client. First we include cookieParser in the project in the `server.js` file so cookie methods can be used anywhere in the app.

`$ npm install --save cookie-parser`

Next import cookie parser in `server.js` and add it as middelware. 

```js
...
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
...
var app = express();
...
app.use(cookieParser()); // Add this after you initialize express. 
...
```

Next we'll set the cookie. (We'll want our JWT cookie variable's name to bit unique so it doesn't get confusing with other sites, so we'll use the variable `nToken`.) We want to set the cookie when someone signs up and logsin. In `auth-controller.js` update the post /sign-up route. 

```js
...
  user.save().then((user) => {
      var token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, process.env.SECRET, { expiresIn: "60 days" });
      res.cookie('nToken', token, { maxAge: 900000, httpOnly: true });
      res.redirect('/');
...
```

Now lets see if the cookie is set by examining the cookies in another request, say just to the root route `/`.

```js
  console.log(req.cookies);
```

You can also see this cookie in the client under Developer Tools > Application tab > Cookies, or by typing in `document.cookies` in the client console.

# Let's Logout

Now that we have signed up, let's log out. Since "being logged in" just means that the cookie is set, we can create a new `/logout` route that just removes this cookie.

```html
<ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
  <li><a href="/logout">Logout</a></li>
  <li><a href="/login">Login</a></li>
  <li><a href="/sign-up">Sign Up</a></li>
</ul>
```

> [info]
> It might be more accurate to use the DELETE method, because we are sort of deleting something, but we will just use the get method to simplify our requests at this point.

```js
  // LOGOUT
  app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
    res.clearCookie('nToken');
    res.redirect('/');
  });
```

After you click the "Logout" link is the cookie still present in the server in `req.cookies` or in the client in Dev Tools > Application > Cookies?

# Let's Login

Now that we've signed up, logged out, now let's login. We can use the same pattern as we did with the `/sign-up` routes, with one GET and one POST both with the path `/login`.

First let's build the GET route and template. You can copy and modify the sign up template to create login template. 

```js
  // LOGIN FORM
  app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
    res.render('login.hbs');
  });
```

Use the `sign-up` template code to make a login form.

Now let's make the logic for the POST route to `/login` work.

```js
// LOGIN
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const password = req.body.password;
  // Find this user name
  User.findOne({ username }, 'username password').then((user) => {
    if (!user) {
      // User not found
      return res.status(401).send({ message: 'Wrong Username or Password' });
    }
    // Check the password
    user.comparePassword(password, (err, isMatch) => {
      if (!isMatch) {
        // Password does not match
        return res.status(401).send({ message: "Wrong Username or password"});
      }
      // Create a token
      const token = jwt.sign(
        { _id: user._id, username: user.username }, process.env.SECRET,
        { expiresIn: "60 days" }
      );
      // Set a cookie and redirect to root
      res.cookie('nToken', token, { maxAge: 900000, httpOnly: true });
      res.redirect('/');
    });
  }).catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  });
});
```

Phew!

If we did everything right, now we should be able to sign up, log out, and login securely. We even got a 
little bit of authorization working showing and hiding the login, sign up, logout links. Nice! In the next 
chapter we'll associate our user record with our posts and comments.

WOOOHOOO!

# Stretch: More Authentication Patterns

There is a lot more to make a full fledged authentication system. See which ones you want to try:

1. Add a Remember Me checkbox. What is the difference from when it is checked or not?
1. Require a password confirmation field.
1. Plan out how you would do a "forget password" process.
