# New Post Form

To create a new instance of a resource, we first have to make a button to make a new post.

> [action]
> Since making a post is a very important **Call To Action (CTA)**, we'll put it in the navbar.

```html
<li><a href="/posts/new" class="btn btn-primary navbar-btn">New Post</a></li>
```

Next, we have to create the form. Let's follow RESTful routing and make the url match this pattern: `/<<RESOURCE NAME PLURAL>>/new`. In the case of a resource `Post`, the path will be `/posts/new`.

> [action]
> Create this `/posts/new` route and have it render a newly created template named `posts-new.handlebars`.
>
> Now, use the [bootstrap form classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/#overview) to add a form for an object with a `title`, `url`, and `summary` attributes. Your form should have an action that points to a `create` route => `/posts`.
>
> **Remember** to put this form in the center 4 columns of a grid.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4">
    <form action="/posts/new" method="post">
      <legend>New Post</legend>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="post-title">Title</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="title"
          class="form-control"
          id="post-title"
          placeholder="Title"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="post-url">Url</label>
        <input
          type="url"
          name="url"
          class="form-control"
          id="post-url"
          placeholder="https://www.google.com"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="post-summary">Summary</label>
        <textarea
          name="summary"
          class="form-control"
          id="post-summary"
          placeholder="Summary"
        ></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class="text-right">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Create Post</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

Your nav bar should look like the following:

![NEW POST BUTTON](assets/new-post-button.png)

And the form:
![NEW POST FORM](assets/new-post-form.png)

# Submit the Form

So what happens when you submit this form?

Nothing! We're missing a `/posts/new` route, so let's make it.

> [action]
> First, make a new folder called `controllers`. Within, create the file `posts.js`.
>
```js
module.exports = (app) => {
  // CREATE
  app.post('/posts/new', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
  });
};
```
>
> Next, require this file in your `server.js` file, and pass in the `app` variable as an argument.
>
```js
require('./controllers/posts')(app);
```

What happens when you submit the form?

Is `req.body` defined? No?

That's because you need to parse the json coming in through the `req.body`.

It's time to get `req.body` to reflect and contain the submitted form inputs from your front-end.

# Req.body for Middleware

Research what [express json](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) does in the documentation.

While you're at it, also research the role of [express validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/). What role does it play alongside the `express.json()` middleware?

Essentially, `express.json()` is a necessary middleware to communicate with your `POST` requests.

`express-validator` is a wrapper around [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) that validates and sanitizes string inputs.

> [info]
> In production, your users will try to type in all kinds of nonsense into your forms --- even things your site wasn't intended to deal with! `express-validator` plugs into the Express.js ecosystem and helps keep you and your code safe.

<!-- -->

> [action]
> Install `express-validator`:
>
```bash
npm install express-validator
```

> Note: as of npm 5.0.0 installed modules are added as a dependency by default. The `--save` option is no longer needed.

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

# Connecting to your database

You're going to need to connect to a NoSQL database called [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/). Look through the documentation as a reference if you get stuck. It's just a good habit to get into.

> [action]
> Let's start off by creating a new `/data` folder in the top-level structure of your project, then create a new JavaScript file.
>
> Open your terminal and type:
>
```bash
mkdir data
cd data
touch reddit-db.js
```

Now, we need to make sure that we have `mongodb` installed by doing a `which` command.

> [action]
> You should see a destination path to the Mongo executable:
>
```bash
$ which mongod
/usr/local/bin/mongod
```
>
> We're also going to make sure that our Mongo database is running:
>
```bash
brew services restart mongodb-community
```

Great! Next, we're going to use the `reddit-db.js` file we made earlier to connect to the database.

> [action]
> Open `reddit-db.js`, and paste the following code inside:
>
```js
/* Mongoose Connection */
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
assert = require('assert');
>
const url = 'mongodb://localhost/reddit-db';
mongoose.connect(
  url,
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true
  },
  function(err, db) {
    assert.equal(null, err);
    console.log('Connected successfully to database');
>
    // db.close(); turn on for testing
  }
);
mongoose.connection.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection Error:'));
mongoose.set('debug', true);
>
module.exports = mongoose.connection;
```

Now all that's left is to tie this into our main `server.js` file.

> [action]
> Open up `server.js`, and paste this in:
>
```js
// Set db
require('./data/reddit-db');
```

# Saving to the Database

In order to interact with the MongoDB database we're going to use the npm module [`mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). Mongoose is the ODM - the Object Document Mapper. That means that it maps JavaScript objects in our application to documents in the database. Mongoose works through schemas, written in code, called Models.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure that you put all middleware requires **_BEFORE_** all routes (including routes imported from other files), or your routes may not work!

> Read the note above again! No really, re-read it so that you remember to do this throughout the tutorial. Your future self will thank you from all the time/frustration you save

<!-- -->

> [action]
> Create the folder `models` and inside put the `post.js` file. Here's a sample model for our `Post` resource.
> We can use [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to get `Schema` directly from the require statement.
> If you would like a video explaining destructuring check out [JS Destructuring in 100 Seconds](https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=UgEaJBz3bjY)
>
```js
const { Schema, model } = require('mongoose');
>
const postSchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  url: { type: String, required: true },
  summary: { type: String, required: true }
});
>
module.exports = model('Post', postSchema);
```
>
> Now that we have a model, require it at the top of `controllers/posts.js`:
>
```js
const Post = require('../models/post');
```
>
> Put it to use in our "create posts" endpoint:
>
```js
const Post = require('../models/post');
>
module.exports = (app) => {
>
  // CREATE
  app.post('/posts/new', (req, res) => {
    // INSTANTIATE INSTANCE OF POST MODEL
    const post = new Post(req.body);
>
    // SAVE INSTANCE OF POST MODEL TO DB AND REDIRECT TO THE ROOT
    post.save(() => res.redirect('/'));
  });
>
};
```
>
> Notice how `res.direct` is on the same line and we have left out the curly brackets.
> This is not a mistake. If an arrow function only has one line in the curly brackets and we want to return that line, we can put it on the same line and remove the curly brackets.
> [Read more](https://codeburst.io/javascript-understand-arrow-function-syntax-ab4081bba85b?gi=b9a68f0812ca).
> 
> Additionally, we want to ensure we always return the `res` and exit the code execution, unless we have a specific reason why we want to continue the code execution.

# Confirming Posts are Saving

So we can save to the database, but how can we be sure? There are a couple of ways! We could go into the `mongo` shell and inspect our database, observing that the `posts` collection is now populated with documents. Alternatively, we can use a program, [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download), to graphically inspect our database and observe what collections and documents we've created.

Use either the `mongo` shell or [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download) to confirm you are successfully creating posts before moving on.

# Now Commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Users can submit and save posts'
$ git push
```

# STRETCH CHALLENGE: Adding Created At and Updated At Attributes

> [challenge]
> Create a new model, and figure out how you can display these new attributes in your app:
>
```js
const { Schema, model } = require('mongoose');
>
const postSchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  url: { type: String, required: true },
  summary: { type: String, required: true },
}, { timestamps: true });
>
module.exports = model('Post', postSchema);
```

As of Mongoose 4.0 you can now set [timestamps](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#timestamps) options on the Schema and have Mongoose handle the created at and updated at attributes for you. The type assigned is `Date`.
