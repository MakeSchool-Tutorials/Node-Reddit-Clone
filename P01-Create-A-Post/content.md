# New Post Form

To create a new instance of a resource, we first have to make a button to make a new post.

> [action]
>Since making a post is a very important **Call To Action (CTA)**, we'll put it in the navbar.
>
```html
<a href="/posts/new" class="btn btn-primary navbar-btn">New Post</a>
```

Next, we have to create the form. Let's follow RESTful routing and make the url match this pattern: `/<<RESOURCE NAME PLURAL>>/new`. In the case of a resource `Post`, the path will be `/posts/new`.

> [action]
> Create this `/posts/new` route and have it render a newly created template named `posts-new.handlebars`.
>
> Now, use the [bootstrap form classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms) to add a form for an object with a `title`, `url`, and `summary` attributes. Your form should have an action that points to a `create` route => `/posts`.
>
> **Remember** to put this form in the center 4 columns of a grid.
>
```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4">
    <form action="/posts/new" method="post">
      <legend>New Post</legend>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="post-title">Title</label>
        <input type="text" name="title" class="form-control" id="post-title" placeholder="Title">
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="post-url">Url</label>
        <input type="url" name="url" class="form-control" id="post-url" placeholder="https://www.google.com">
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="post-summary">Summary</label>
        <textarea name="summary" class="form-control" id="post-summary" placeholder="Summary"></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class='text-right'>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Create Post</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

Your nav bar should look like the following:

![NEW POST BUTTON](assets/new-post-button.png)

And the form:
![NEW POST FORM](assets/new-post-form.png)

# Submit the Form

So what happens when you submit this form?

Nothing! We're missing a `/posts/new` route, so let's make it.

> [action]
> First, make a new folder called `controllers`. Within, create the file `posts.js`.
>
```js
module.exports = app => {
  // CREATE
  app.post("/posts/new", (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
  });
};
```
>
> Next, require this file in your `server.js` file, and pass in the `app` variable as an argument.
>
```js
  require('./controllers/posts.js')(app);
```

What happens when you submit the form?

Is `req.body` defined? No?

That's because you need to add the [body parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) module.

> [action]
> Install the npm module in order to begin the process:
>
```bash
npm install body-parser --save
```

It's time to get `req.body` to reflect and contain the submitted form inputs from your front-end.

# Req.body for Middleware

Research what [body parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) is on the [npm website](https://npmjs.com).

While you're at it, also research the role of [express validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator). What role does it play alongside the `body-parser` middleware?

Essentially, `body-parser` is a necessary middleware to communicate with your `POST` requests.

`express-validator` is a wrapper around [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) that validates and sanitizes string inputs.

> [info]
> In production, your users will try to type in all kinds of nonsense into your forms --- even things your site wasn't intended to deal with! `express-validator` plugs into the Express.js ecosystem and helps keep you and your code safe.

<!-- -->

> [action]
> Install `express-validator`:
>
```bash
npm install express-validator@^5.3.0 --save
```
>
> Next, add the following two requirements to the top of your `server.js` file, and pass `body-parser` through the `app.use()` module:
>
```js
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const expressValidator = require('express-validator');
>
// Use Body Parser
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
>
// Add after body parser initialization!
app.use(expressValidator());
```

<!-- -->

> [info]
>
> Why did we install a specific version of express-validator? Unfortunately due to [breaking changes in version 6](https://github.com/express-validator/express-validator/releases/v6.0.0), the use of `app.use(expressValidator())` is not supported in later versions of express-validator. Until a proper migration from 5.x to 6.x is released, this tutorial will use this workaround.

# Connecting to your database

You're going to need to connect to a NoSQL database called [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/). Look through the documentation as a reference if you get stuck. It's just a good habit to get into.

> [action]
> Let's start off by creating a new `/data` folder in the top-level structure of your project, then create a new JavaScript file.
>
Open your terminal and type:
>
```bash
>
mkdir data
cd data
touch reddit-db.js
```

Now, we need to make sure that we have `mongodb` installed by doing a `which` command.

> [action]
> You should see a destination path to the Mongo executable:
>
```bash
$ which mongod
/usr/local/bin/mongod
```
>
 We're also going to make sure that our Mongo database is running:
>
```bash
brew services restart mongodb
```

Great! Next, we're going to use the `reddit-db.js` file we made earlier to connect to the database.

> [action]
> Open `reddit-db.js`, and paste the following code inside:
>
```js
/* Mongoose Connection */
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
assert = require("assert");
>
const url = "mongodb://localhost/reddit-db";
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
mongoose.connect(
  url,
  { useNewUrlParser: true },
  function(err, db) {
    assert.equal(null, err);
    console.log("Connected successfully to database");
>
    // db.close(); turn on for testing
  }
);
mongoose.connection.on("error", console.error.bind(console, "MongoDB connection Error:"));
mongoose.set("debug", true);
>
module.exports = mongoose.connection;
```

Now all that's left is to tie this into our main `server.js` file.

> [action]
> Open up `server.js`, and paste this in:
>
```js
// Set db
require('./data/reddit-db');
```

# Saving to the Database

In order to interact with the MongoDB database we're going to use the npm module [`mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). Mongoose is the ODM - the Object Document Mapper. That means that it maps JavaScript objects in our application to documents in the database. Mongoose works through schemas, written in code, called Models.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure that you put all middleware requires **_BEFORE_** all routes (including routes imported from other files), or your routes may not work!

> [action]
>
> Read the note above again! No really, re-read it so that you remember to do this throughout the tutorial. Your future self will thank you from all the time/frustration you save

<!-- -->

> [action]
> Create the folder `models` and inside put the `post.js` file. Here's a sample model for our `Post` resource.
>
```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
>
const PostSchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  url: { type: String, required: true },
  summary: { type: String, required: true }
});
>
module.exports = mongoose.model("Post", PostSchema);
```
>
Now that we have a model, require it at the top of `controllers/posts.js`:
>
```js
const Post = require('../models/post');
```
>
Put it to use in our "create posts" endpoint:
>
```js
const Post = require('../models/post');
>
module.exports = (app) => {
>
  // CREATE
  app.post('/posts/new', (req, res) => {
    // INSTANTIATE INSTANCE OF POST MODEL
    const post = new Post(req.body);
>
    // SAVE INSTANCE OF POST MODEL TO DB
    post.save((err, post) => {
      // REDIRECT TO THE ROOT
      return res.redirect(`/`);
    })
  });
>
};
```

# Confirming Posts are Saving

So we can save to the database, but how can we be sure? There are a couple of ways! We could go into the `mongo` shell and inspect our database, observing that the `posts` collection is now populated with documents. Alternatively, we can use a program, [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download), to graphically inspect our database and observe what collections and documents we've created.

Use either the `mongo` shell or [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download) to confirm you are successfully creating posts before moving on.

# Now Commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Users can submit and save posts'
$ git push
```


# STRETCH CHALLENGE: Adding Created At and Updated At Attributes
> [challenge]
> Create a new model, and figure out how you can display these new attributes in your app:
>
```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
>
const PostSchema = new Schema({
  createdAt: { type: Date },
  updatedAt: { type: Date },
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  url: { type: String, required: true },
  summary: { type: String, required: true }
});
>
PostSchema.pre("save", function(next) {
  // SET createdAt AND updatedAt
  const now = new Date();
  this.updatedAt = now;
>
  if (!this.createdAt) {
    this.createdAt = now;
  }
>
  next();
});
>
module.exports = mongoose.model("Post", PostSchema);
```
